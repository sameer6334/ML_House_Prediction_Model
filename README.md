# üè° California Housing Price Prediction ‚Äî End-to-End ML Pipeline

This project focuses on building a **complete machine learning pipeline** to predict **California housing prices** using **Scikit-Learn** and regression algorithms.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, I:

- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (`housing.csv`) with:
  - Handling missing values using `SimpleImputer`
  - Feature scaling
  - Encoding categorical features using a **custom pipeline**
- Applied **Stratified Split** to maintain distribution of income categories between train and test sets.
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
- Used **Cross-Validation** to compare model performance using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**.
- Discovered that **Random Forest Regressor** gave the **best and most stable performance**.

## üß† Model Deployment Logic

I developed a script that:

- Trains the **Random Forest model** and **saves it using `joblib`**.
- Uses an **if-else logic** to **skip retraining if the model is already saved**.
- Reads new input data from `input.csv`, applies the pipeline, and **predicts `median_house_value`**.
- Exports predictions to **`output.csv`** for easy inference.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Complete ML pipeline using **ColumnTransformer + Pipeline**
- **Automated preprocessing** for both training and inference stages
- **Joblib-based model persistence**
- **Production-style inference workflow**
- Simply drop your `input.csv` and run ‚Üí **Get predictions instantly**
